Unified Networking Lab is not only an enhanced iou-web version. UNetLab is a totally new way to building labs:

* based on SDN, it will be a good platform to test SDN controllers;
* IOU, Dynamips, eNSP (Huawei), LXC and full virtualized devices (CS31000V, vXR, Juniper, WAAS, firewall...) will be (hopefully) supported;
* L2 switches can (hopefully) be powered by L2IOU, Huawei virtualized switches and/or physical switches (required physical interfaces);
* serial communication between IOU, Dynamips and Huawei routers will be (hopefully) supported;
* "cloud" devices will not be a "must", but they still remain available;
* distributed servers can run same lab environment;
* multi tenant;
* Web UI.

Don't know **if**, **how** and **when** it will be available, but if you want to join, just [drop me an email](/about/ "Contact Me") or support my work.
