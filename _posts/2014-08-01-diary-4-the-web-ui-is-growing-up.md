The web-ui is gronwing up, based on [jQuery](http://jquery.com/ "jQuery"), [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/ "Bootstrap"), [Bootstrap Validator](http://bootstrapvalidator.com/ "Bootstrap Validator") and [PHP](http://php.net/ "PHP") of course:

The first released version will support all features of iou-web and maybe something more (like Qemu and Dynamips).

First version  won't probably support multi user/tenant (backend is ready, web-ui is not).
