## EVE-NG Fraudster Alert

Please be aware about Fraudsters trying to steal your money by asking donations for unl/eve project.

Fraudster pages:


* [http://eve-cloud.com](http://eve-cloud.com "http://eve-cloud.com") 
* [http://unlcloud.com](http://unlcloud.com "http://unlcloud.com") 

Those pages belong to the same person and have no relations with UNL/EVE team.

The official UNL/EVE team members are [HERE](http://www.unetlab.com/about/#toc1 "UNL/EVE Team") 

If you will donate, your money will not reach UNL/EVE team ever.
