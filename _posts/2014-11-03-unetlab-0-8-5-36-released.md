Finally the first beta of UNetLab has been released. Beta means:

* not stable;
* not fully tested;
* missing a lot of features.

Because many guys asked me for, I changed from closed to open beta. You should not use this beta unless you are good in Linux and can debug issues by yourself.

New features:

* Cloud devices can interconnect many devices.
* Web User Interface is HTML based.
* All images can run within a single environment (no more dealing with multiple hypervisor, virtual machines and compatibility issues).

New supported images:

* Alcatel 7750
* Arista vEOS
* Dynamips
* Cisco IOU/IOL
* Cisco XRv
* Cisco CSR1000V
* Cisco vIOS
* Cisco vIOS L2
* Cisco Titanium
* Juniper vSRX
